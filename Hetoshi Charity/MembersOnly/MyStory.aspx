            <li><p class="big">In 2014 I moved to Colorado and met a wonderful group of people: <a class="link-team" href="index.cfm?fuseaction=donordrive.team&amp;teamID=38593">Team Savannah</a></p> </li> 
            <li><p class="big">Since then, I've been a part of Team Savannah, raising money for the Children's hospital of Denver Colorado</p> </li> 
            <li><p class="big">This year I'm playing for Gillette's Hospital of St Paul Minnesota.</p> </li> 
            <li><p class="big">My sister was born 3 months premature in 1982, and was in critical care for 6 months following her birth.  
                If not for children's Hospitals like Gillette's, my sister would not be alive today.</p> </li>
